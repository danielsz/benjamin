** Timed idempotency with side-effects

#+HTML: <img src="image/benjamin.jpg" width="340" height="360" align="right"/>

Benjamin gives you a macro that transforms code like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(let [logbook (get-logbook entity)]
  (when (some pred logbook)
    (let [response (body)]
      (when (success? response)
        (write logbook)))))
#+END_SRC

Into this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure 
(with-logbook entity :event
  body)
#+END_SRC 

There is a [[http://danielsz.github.io/2017/08/07/Timed-idempotency][blog]] post that delves in the motivation and backstory.

** Installation 
[[https://clojars.org/org.danielsz/benjamin/latest-version.svg]]
** Usage

In your namespace, require:
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[benjamin.core :refer [with-logbook]]
#+END_SRC

** Configuration

- ~logbook-fn~ A function that retrieves a logbook given an entity.
- ~persistence-fn~ A function that persists an updated logbook given an entity and an event
- ~success-fn~ A predicate function that determines the succes of ~body~.
- ~events~ A Clojure map with events as keys and predicates as values.
- ~allow-undeclared-events?~ a boolean that allows of forbids events that are not registered in the ~events~ map.

*Tip:*  ~system~ users can configure this library via a [[https://github.com/danielsz/system/blob/f4acb68d1e136720c1f9ab44d65e2eb763b1e6ef/src/system/components/benjamin.clj][component]] that ships with the latest snapshot. 
 
Manual configuration is done by requiring: 

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[benjamin.configuration :refer [set-config!]]
#+END_SRC

*** Accessing the logbook

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-config! :logbook-fn f)
#+END_SRC

~logbook-fn~ is a function that receives the entity as argument and returns a logbook. 
The default is ~:logbook~ which will work when the entity map embeds the logbook, as in:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
{:first-name "Benjamin"
 :last-name "Peirce"
 :occupation "Mathematician"
 :email "benjamin.peirce@harvard.edu"
 :logbook [{:welcome-email timestamp}
           {:subscription-reminder timestamp}
           {:subscription-reminder timestamp}
           {:newsletter timestamp}
           {:newsletter timestamp}
           {:newsletter timestamp}]}
#+END_SRC

*** Deriving predicates from events

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-config! :events {:event predicate
                      :event predicate
                      :event predicate
                      ...})
#+END_SRC

Predicates are one argument functions that receive a logbook entry. A logbook entry is a map with an event as the key and a timestamp as the value. 

The following example checks if the logbook entry was written today.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
#(if-let [date (first (vals %))]
   (time/today? date)
   false)
#+END_SRC

Several predicates are offered in the ~benjamin.predicates~ namespace for convenience. That namespace has a dependency that you need to require in your build should you want to use them. This is because ~benjamin~ does not have any dependency of its own (it relies entirely on language features).

** Writing to the logbook

~:persistence-fn~ is a function of two arguments, ~entity~ and ~event~. Its responsibility is to append to the logbook and persist the entity.
You have to provide an implementation or an error will be thrown. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-config! :persistence-fn
             (fn [entity event] (let [logbook (conj (:logbook entity) {event (t/now)})]
                                 (assoc entity :logbook logbook)
                                 (save db entity))))
#+END_SRC

*Tip:* If you have dependencies (as a reference to the db), use a higher–order function that returns ~persistence-fn~.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(defn logbook [{{store :store} :db :as dependencies}]
  (fn [entity event] (let [logbook (conj (:logbook entity) {event (t/now)})]
                       (assoc entity :logbook logbook)
                       (save db entity)))
#+END_SRC
*Tip:* The ~benjamin~ component in the ~system~ library includes an option that will wrap dependencies associated with it in the system map.

** Determining the status of the side-effect

The success function is a function of one argument, ie. the return value of the side-effectful body.
It determines if the operation was successful and thus for inclusion in the logbook.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-config! :success-fn (constantly true))
#+END_SRC

The default assumes all your operations will be A-okay. You’ll probably want to pass along something more realistic.

** Strict or lax policy with unknown events

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(with-logbook entity event
  body)
#+END_SRC   

If the event is unkown, that is if it doesn’t show up in the events map, no predicate can be derived and then we rely on a policy you can set yourself. 
Either we accept unknown events and we proceed with the side-effect, or we reject them and return immediately. The default is strict, but you can change that.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(set-config! :allow-undeclared-events? true)
#+END_SRC

** Tests

A test suite is provided in ~benjamin.core-test~. Call ~(test-ns *ns*)~ in the namespace, or run ~boot testing~ for continous testing.

** Limitations

You can work with as many entities you want. You can declare as many events as you want. You can have any side-effectful procedures in the body. Your ~success-fn~ may dispatch on the return value if you run different types of operations in the body.

The configuration is a singleton with dynamic scope, so deal with it to the best of your understanding. Personally, I set it once and treat it as a constant for the lifetime of the application.

Licensing terms will be revealed shortly. In the meantime, do what you want with it.
